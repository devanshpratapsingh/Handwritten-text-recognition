# Handwritten-text-recognition
Handwritten text recognition system implemented with TensorFlow and trained on the the MNIST database of handwritten digits. This Neural Network model will recognise a single letter or word contained in the image. We will be using Python3, numpy, TensorFlow 2.3 and OpenCV.

These are the basic steps:
Load data from the mnist dataset
Normalize the data
Create the model and add layers
Compile the model  and train it.
Evaluate the loss and accuracy and print the same
Save the model
Load the input image
Invert the image(white becomes black and vice versa)
Model will predict on test data
Display the output (in grayscale)
